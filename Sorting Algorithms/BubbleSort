Bubble Sort Algorithm
1. In Bubble sort algorithm we compare the first two elements of an array and swap them if required.
2. If we want to sort the elements of array in ascending order and if the first element is greater than second then, we need to swap the elements.
3. If the first element is smaller than second, we donâ€™t need to swap the elements. This process go on until last and second last element is compared and swapped.
